FancyMenu Video Player

This folder contains the HTML/JS implementation of the video player used by the FancyMenu mod.

The player.html file is loaded by MCEF to create a video player that can be controlled from Java.

If you're experiencing any issues with the video player:

1. Make sure MCEF is properly installed and loaded
2. Check that this folder and its contents are properly included in the mod resources
3. Verify that your video files are in a supported format (MP4, WebM, OGG are recommended)
4. Check browser compatibility (Chromium has good video format support)

For more information, see the README.md file in the de.keksuccino.fancymenu.util.rendering.video package.
