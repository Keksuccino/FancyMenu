- Make buddy not go into excited, stretching or hopping mode while sad.
- Hopping is WAY too fast and glitchy. We need to fix that.
- Sit state
- Waving state
- Yawning state
- Sleepy state (combine with yawning shortly after maybe?)
- When energy is low, show sleepy state instead of sad
- Poop mechanism (poop will stay on the ground until the user cleans it by left-clicking it)
- Washing mechanism (new button in radial menu for washing; will give the user a shower head to wash buddy; washing will need 10 seconds, then the action ends)
