- Make buddy way less likely to poop

- Make stats decrease way slower (10 times slower maybe)

- Buddy should peek first for some time before he actually comes out to walk around
  - Will peek from the left and right screen edges randomly
  - Will not have any needs and states and will not loose stats (hunger, energy, etc.)
  - Will peek for like 9 times with delays of 3-6 minutes between the peeks before coming out
  - Add new state PEEKING to animate the peeking (mirror to let him peek from left and right)
