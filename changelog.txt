CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.5.1

- Ported mod to MC 1.21.5
- The old "Custom Localizations" system got removed, so it's now not possible anymore to load localizations using FancyMenu's own localization file format

  - Combining this with the new Parallax feature for Image backgrounds makes it possible to render layered parallax backgrounds
- Elements will now always stay at the same position when their anchor point gets changed (this was previously only the case when changing their anchor via hovering)

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.3.0
 
IMPORTANT: I developed this update over a long time, so it's possible that I forgot about some changes and didn't mention them here. Sorry for that.

- Added tons of new placeholders related to the current world/server the player is in (too many to list all of them, just go exploring :p)

- Removed hardcoded incompatibility with RRLS (Remove Reloading Screen) in MC 1.20.1 (#858)

- Fixed customized Vanilla widgets show as uncustomized in the editor despite having a layout open that customizes said widgets in MC 1.20+ (maybe 1.19+)

%changelog:end%




CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.2.0

- Added support for FMA (FancyMenu Animation) files, which is a new animated texture format created for FancyMenu
  - This format is very similar to FM's old animation format, but it's now a single file and has very similar features as GIF and APNG images
  - FMA files have no audio support, because it's an animated texture format (there will be video support for that in the future)
- There's now a "modpack mode" that disables all overlays and hotkeys to toggle overlays
  - You need to manually enable this mode by setting "modpack_mode" to "true" in "/config/fancymenu/options.txt"
- Player Entity elements fail to get their skin less often now (added fallback API (Minetools) for when Mojang's API is _not in the right mood_)
- For developers:
  - It should now be possible to access all of FancyMenu's registries in the mod init phase (Fabric, Forge & NeoForge) without any problems
  - It's now possible to control if elements, placeholders, loading requirements, actions and menu backgrounds should show up in their "Add" menus
    - This for example makes it possible to allow elements/placeholders/requirements/actions/backgrounds only for specific types of screens
  - You can now control if universal layouts should get applied to specific types of screens
  - Visibility and active state suppliers for ContextMenus are now stackable
  - You can now control the visibility of FancyMenu's customization overlay (without, for example, completely blacklisting a screen)
- Fixed Ticker element not saving its tick delay value

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.1.7
 
- Dropped versions (1.20.2, 1.20.4 and 1.20.5) will get this update, but they remain "dropped" and will not get other feature updates in the future
 
- Moved the "Copy File/Folder" action to a separate optional addon ("FancyMenu System Interactions Addon") to make it more obvious it is used (action is opt-in now)
- Moved the "Delete File/Folder" action to a separate optional addon ("FancyMenu System Interactions Addon") to make it more obvious it is used (action is opt-in now)
- Moved the "Download File" action to a separate optional addon ("FancyMenu System Interactions Addon") to make it more obvious it is used (action is opt-in now)
- Moved the "Move File/Folder" action to a separate optional addon ("FancyMenu System Interactions Addon") to make it more obvious it is used (action is opt-in now)
- Moved the "Open File/Folder" action to a separate optional addon ("FancyMenu System Interactions Addon") to make it more obvious it is used (action is opt-in now)
- Moved the "Rename File/Folder" action to a separate optional addon ("FancyMenu System Interactions Addon") to make it more obvious it is used (action is opt-in now)
- Moved the "Unpack ZIP File" action to a separate optional addon ("FancyMenu System Interactions Addon") to make it more obvious it is used (action is opt-in now)

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.1.6 for MC 1.20.6

There was no update needed for 1.20.6, so I just added the MC 1.20.6 tag to the existing builds on CurseForge and Modrinth.

I will also instantly drop support for MC 1.20.5.

%changelog:end%




CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.1.6

- Dropped support for MC 1.20.4
- Ported to MC 1.20.5
- Removed option to toggle the header/footer shadow/separator of scroll lists in MC 1.20.5+
- Removed option of Custom GUIs to toggle the dark transparent background overlay that used to get rendered when in a world, because it no longer exists in MC
- MC 1.20.5+ renders a dark background overlay in scrollable screens and FancyMenu respects this overlay and renders custom backgrounds BEHIND this overlay
  - This avoids difficult to read scroll list items
  - This overlay can be removed with a resource pack ("textures/gui/menu_list_background.png" and "textures/gui/inworld_menu_list_background.png")
- I noticed a strange bug (?) that bricks the target screen when leaving the editor, so you get redirected to the Title screen for now, because that seems to fix it
- Added an option to MC 1.20.5+ to render the dark screen background overlay rendered by Vanilla Minecraft on custom screen backgrounds (disabled by default)

%changelog:end%




CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.1.3
 
- Added "Music Controller" element to control Vanilla music that plays in menus
  - Because it's an element, it works per-screen, not only globally like before
  - Includes the world music that keeps playing in menus that don't pause the game
  - Old global option in settings should still work normal and will not get removed
- The mod should now respect the loop count of GIF images (like it already did with APNGs)
- It is now possible to randomize slideshows
- Removed "Loop Animated Textures" option for Button and Slider element background textures
  - This feature was a forgotten v2-relic that did not work anymore in v3
  - The mod now respects loop counts of both APNG and GIF textures, so you can simply "disable" looping by making a non-looping GIF/APNG
- Most of FancyMenu's screens should now adjust their GUI scale if buttons get out of screen because the window is too small or the GUI scale too big
- All of FancyMenu's commands are now normal server-side commands (like every Vanilla command)
  - This means that you now need FancyMenu on the server if you plan to use FM commands in multiplayer
  - Makes commands way more stable and fixes potential glitches and bugs caused by FM registering the same command twice (on client and server)
- "Remove Reloading Screen" is now listed as incompatible for older Minecraft versions (before 1.20.4)
  - The game will not start if RRLS is installed while having FancyMenu installed in MC versions before 1.20.4
  - Both mods seem to work fine together in 1.20.4+, so RRLS is not listed as incompatible there
- Fixed all custom window icon files showing as set, but still unable to enable custom window icon toggle
- Fixed skin and cape textures of Player Entity elements not updating correctly (showing old, outdated textures) (thanks adamk33n3r!)
- Fixed missing feedback when the mod failed to open a screen via the "Open Screen" action
- Fixed missing feedback when the mod failed to mimic a button via the "Mimic Button" action
- Fixed "Is Singleplayer" loading requirement returning true when Singleplayer world is "opened to LAN"
- Fixed "/fmvariable" command not working when executed via "/execute as" Vanilla command
- Fixed Markdown quote text formatting never ends quote
- Fixed unable to connect to servers without FancyMenu installed on NeoForge
- Fixed "/openguiscreen" command gets sent to chat instead of executing it as command in MC 1.18.2

- Local sources in the Manage Resource Pre-Load screen now show as short paths (not absolute paths anymore)

- Added French localization by Mozork01
- Added "start_rotation" property to cubic panoramas to set the rotation angle they should start at (value between 0 and 360)
- Added "Repeat Texture" mode to Image element that lets you render tileable (seamless) images as repeating texture (like the default Minecraft dirt menu background)
- Added "Repeat Texture" mode to Image menu background that lets you render tileable (seamless) images as repeating texture (like the default Minecraft dirt menu background)

- Fixed unable to hide Customization Overlay in some mod screens
  - This fixes the incompatibility with the Pixelmon mod
  - This could also fix the "bug" that makes it look like FancyMenu's shortcuts aren't working (they work, but nothing happens, because the overlay stays visible)
- Fixed Input Field element not correctly saving some settings
- Fixed [1.20.4] Custom screen backgrounds not working in screens with scroll lists (like Singleplayer screen; backgrounds still act a bit different there compared to older MC versions, but at least they work)

- Fixed conflict with "ukulib" (Fixed on ukulib's side in ukulib v1.1.2)
- Fixed conflict with "Applied Energistics 2 Wireless Terminals" (and maybe base mod as well)

  - The header an footer can be customized in the "Header/Footer Customizations" menu when right-clicking the editor background (this was the "Scroll List Customizations" menu before)
- Fixed some mod incompatibilities related to how FancyMenu handles screens with tab navigation bars
  - This should fix the incompatibility with MidnightLib that caused ModMenu to freeze/crash in some situations
- Added option to toggle if Custom GUIs should pause the game while in a world
- Added option to toggle if Custom GUIs should render their transparent Vanilla-like in-game world background

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.0.0 - The "Don't Panic, Your Layouts Still Work" Update
 
IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ!
 
Most layouts should still work fine, but some very deprecated stuff (and the Audio element of the extension)
got removed, so there will be some special cases where you need to fix some parts.
 
The following changelog only contains SOME of the maaaany changes in FancyMenu v3.
It's just too much stuff to mention every change in detail.
It's also very likely that I forgot some of the bigger changes, because I worked on v3 for over 8 months.
In these 8+ months I rewrote like 90% of the code (some parts multiple times), shared progress updates with
you all and got a lot of feedback from you to polish as many of the new/rewritten stuff as possible!
 
Thank you SO MUCH to all of the Alpha and Beta testers and people who made suggestions for v3!
This update wouldn't be possible without you! <3
 
But well, since sooo much stuff got rewritten in this update, there's like no chance it will not contain bugs and some of them
could harm your layouts, so please make sure to BACKUP YOUR LAYOUTS AND MINECRAFT INSTANCE before updating to this version!
 
And now have fun reading that frickin book, uhm I mean changelog!
 
tl;dr: BACKUP your LAYOUTS and Minecraft INSTANCE before updating!
 
------------------------------
 
- The new wiki for v3: docs.fancymenu.net
 
- FancyMenu v3 is available for 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.20.1, 1.20.4 and future Minecraft versions (all other versions not listed here get dropped with v3)
 
- Old Audio elements from the Audio extension don't work anymore, you need to add the new Audio element of the base mod (sorry)
 
- Old v2 layouts, variables, custom GUIs and other things get CONVERTED to v3, so there's no going back to v2 after loading your setuo in v3!
--> Make sure to backup your setup before loading it in v3!
 
- Button tooltips (custom and Vanilla buttons) now look like Vanilla ones
- Button tooltips will not jump to the complete opposite site of the mouse cursor anymore when hitting the edge of the screen
- If "Preserve Background Aspect Ratio" is enabled, menu backgrounds will now always get rendered with the correct aspect ratio, no matter how big/small the screen is
- Orientations are now called "Anchor Points"
- You can now use all customizable Vanilla elements of menus as base for the "Element" anchor point (was only Vanilla buttons before)
- All assets (textures, sounds, etc.) now need to be in "config/fancymenu/assets" (old assets still work, but new ones need to be in the assets dir)
- Variables now get saved in a new format (Old variables get converted to the new format, but you need to enable "Reset on Launch" again, because the config option for it no longer exists)
- New elements now stay on screen by default (they never go out of screen by resizing the window or changing the GUI scale; this can be disabled per-element)
- New elements now have "mid-centered" as default anchor point
- When adding a new element by using the right-click context menu, the new element will now get added at the spot where you've opened the context menu
- Custom window icon system now allows you to set your own icon paths (You will need to set your custom icons again and move them to /config/fancymenu/assets/)
- You don't need to restart the game anymore after changing the custom window icon(s) (gets updated automatically)
- You don't need to restart the game anymore after changing the custom window title (gets updated automatically)
- The "/openguiscreen" and "/closeguiscreen" commands now accept a player argument to remotely open/close GUIs for other players (OP permissions needed)
- The "/openguiscreen" and "/closeguiscreen" commands can now be executed from console (as non-player) by setting a player argument
- The "/fmvariable" command now supports setting values with spaces, quotation marks and backslashes
- Completely reworked all APIs and registries (so if you've used these in an extension mod, this mod is broken now, sorry >.<)
- Most UI stuff got a full rewrite (context menus, menu bars, screens, etc.)
- FancyMenu's settings are now part of the menu bar at the top of menu screens and should be way easier to navigate through now
- The header and footer textures of scrollable screens (like Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Video Settings, etc.) are now customizable
- It's now possible to set an inactive background for buttons (inactive means greyed out and not clickable)
- There's a short placeholder format for variables now: $$variable_name
- The action system now supports IF, ELSE-IF und ELSE statements (IF and ELSE-IF take loading requirements)
- You can drag-&-drop actions (and statements) in the "Edit Actions" screen now (to move them)
- Complex loading requirements like "Is Number" now have a GUI to build/edit their values more easily
- Complex actions like "Execute Terminal/CMD Command" now have a GUI to build/edit their values more easily
- FancyMenu's "config.txt" file is now called "options.txt" (It's NOT recommended to rename the old one to "options.txt"!)
--> This also means everything from the old config needs to get set again (like custom window title, window icon, etc.) (sorry for that!)
- The pose of Player Entity elements is now fully customizable (Every body part can be rotated on its X, Y and Z axis, except base body/torso, which only rotates on X and Y)
- Player Entity elements now have separate "follow mouse" toggles for head and body
- Player Entity elements now keep their customized pose while "follow mouse" is enabled
- Player Entity elements now have full placeholder support for pose (all body part rotations) and scale
- Most screens now have shorter, universal identifiers (no too.long.identifiers.nobody.can.read anymore!)
- Universal identifiers (previously known as "compatibility identifiers") for buttons are now shorter (there's no "button_compatibility_id:" prefix anymore)
- All elements of the Progress Screen are now customizable
- All elements of the Level Loading Screen are now customizable
- All elements of the Receiving Level Screen are now customizable
- All elements of the Connect Screen are now customizable
- It is now possible to set a serialized text component (like in the '/tellraw' command for example) as label for buttons and as text for Splash Text elements
- The "Execute Terminal/CMD Command" action now prints its process output to the game log
- There's now a layout index system to customize the loading order of multi-layout setups (multiple layouts for the same menu)
- The old overlay to show the screen identifier got replaced with a full debug overlay that shows useful information about performance, loaded layouts and more
- You can now fully customize Vanilla/Mod Slider handle and background textures
- The Image menu background type now supports web sources (and allows you to set a local fallback texture in case the web source fails to load)
- It's now possible to set GIF images as menu background
- Text elements are now locked at a maximum of 45,000 characters, because the game isn't really usable anymore when using longer texts
- The placeholder parser is now locked at a maximum of 17,000 characters per text that can be checked for placeholders
--> So if you use placeholders in text elements, this overrides the normal 45,000 characters maximum
- Universal layouts now get always loaded BEFORE normal ones, so normal layouts can override parts of universal ones
- The grid in the layout editor now always gets rendered at the same scale, no matter what GUI scale is used
- FancyMenu now supports APNG textures (Animated PNGs, like GIFs, but better)
- It is now possible to pre-load specific resources

- Panoramas should now load when its properties file name is "properties.txt.txt" (you know why)
- Slideshows should now load when its properties file name is "properties.txt.txt" (you know why)
 
- Animations are now deprecated!
--> APNGs exist now (and maybe videos soon), so there's no real need for animations anymore
--> It's not possible to add new Animation elements to layouts, but existing ones still work for now
--> Animations can't get set as game intro anymore, but existing animation intros still work for now
--> Animations can't get set as button background anymore, but existing animation button backgrounds still work for now
--> Animations can't get set as menu background anymore, but existing animation menu background still work for now

--> Toggle the text shadow of all of FancyMenu's UI text
--> Toggle the click sound of all of FancyMenu's UI elements
--> FancyMenu's UI Scale is now "Auto" by default (automatically shows the UI at scale 2 instead of 1 if the window is bigger than 1920x1080)
 
- The Layout Editor got a full rewrite
--> Better menu navigation
--> Added an anchor point overlay that shows the anchor of elements and lets you set the anchor of elements by hovering over an anchor
--> You can now move multiple elements at the same time with the mouse by holding CTRL (was only possible by using the arrow keys before)
--> Replaced "moving/dragging not allowed" message when moving an element with indicator that tells you the element in not moveable
--> You can now draw a mouse selection rectangle to select multiple elements
--> There's a "Layer" widget now that lets you easily reorder elements (and it lets you rename elements!)
--> Removed the delete confirmation for elements, because undo/redo exists

--> There's now full markdown support for web and local text sources
--> Special markdown formatting code to colorize text parts with HEX colors

--> Just like Vanilla Sliders, custom ones have fully customizable textures now (handle and background)
--> Old Slider elements are deprecated now
 
- Reworked Audio elements
--> Their options got simplified while keeping all features of the old version
--> They now have a detailed memory of what tracks they already played, so even in Shuffle mode they only play every audio once per loop (or once in total if not looping)
--> They never play the same track twice in a row (well except they only have one track)
--> The logic of when Audio elements keep playing across menus is more in line with the rest of FM now, so Audio elements only keep playing across menus if they are part of a universal layout now
--> The Manage Tracks GUI lets you easily reorder tracks to let them play in the correct order (if not in Shuffle)
--> They support WEB audio sources now!
--> Oh and they are part of the BASE MOD now! No Audio extension anymore!
 
- Reworked Custom GUIs
--> OLD SCREEN OVERRIDES DON'T WORK ANYMORE! You need to override screens again (sorry >.<)
--> They should now be way more stable and shouldn't cause so many issues anymore
--> Custom GUIs can now be managed more easily (custom GUI controls are now located in the "Customization" tab of the menu bar)
--> Overriding Vanilla/Mod screens should be more stable now and there's now a menu where you can see and manage (delete) all overridden screens
 
- Removed deprecated (old) text element and web text element (this does not affect the new text element added in FancyMenu v2.12.0)
- Removed deprecated background audio feature of layouts, since the Audio Extension is a thing now (install the extension mod and add an Audio element to the layout)
- Removed deprecated feature to use the localization key/label of a Vanilla button to identify it (this was an _ancient_ thing and was probably unused zombie code for like 2-3 years)
- Removed deprecated 'prevbackground' and 'nextbackground' actions (leftover of ancient menu background handling; wasn't really functional anymore in modern layouts)
- Removed deprecated 'opencustomgui' action, because 'opengui' can open custom GUIs for a long time now
- Removed deprecated (old) placeholder system (the old ones that looked like %placeholder%, not the new JSON-like ones)
- Removed legacy "Required Mods" option of layouts, since loading requirements can be used for that instead
- Removed legacy "Maximum/Minimum Minecraft Version" option of layouts, since loading requirements can be used for that instead
- Removed legacy "Maximum/Minimum FancyMenu Version" option of layouts, since loading requirements can be used for that instead
- Removed legacy "Screen Height/Width Requirements" option of layouts, since loading requirements can be used for that instead
- Removed legacy "Only In Multiplayer/Singleplayer" options of button elements, because loading requirements can be used for that instead
- Removed customizability of the Vanilla Splash Text element in the Title Screen, because you can simply add a custom one and set it to Vanilla mode
- Removed config options to toggle the visibility of the percentage and chunk elements of the Level Loading Screen (these are now customizable in the layout editor)
 
- Fixed: Probably a lot of bugs that were caused by old spaghetti code (and probably added the same amount of new bugs)
- Fixed: MC 1.19.4+: Vanilla buttons that got moved or resized flicker when resizing some screens like the Create World screen
- Fixed: Button tooltips sometimes sticking to next menu screen
- Fixed: Copyright button is deletable (you can't delete or resize it anymore, but moving still works as long as the button stays on-screen)
- Fixed: Resizing not working correctly when using the "Element" anchor point
- Fixed: Element-Info (X-pos, Y-pos, width, etc.) at the side of elements in the editor can go off-screen when the element is too far right or at the top
- Fixed: Incompatibility with "Remove Reloading Screen" mod
- Fixed: Minecraft's "/help" command doesn't work correctly for FancyMenu's "/fmvariable" command
- Fixed: "&" formatting codes in "Paste to Chat" action get replaced with "§" formatting codes
- Fixed: "&" formatting codes in "Send Message" action get replaced with "§" formatting codes
- Fixed: Crash when pressing DELETE on an empty line in the text editor
- Fixed: It is possible to remove/reset the Forced GUI Scale of a layout without disabling Auto-Scaling first, which can lead to the layout scaling the menu to infinity
- Fixed: Panoramas sometimes not loading properly (not showing up in panorama menu)

- Added: Config option to reset specific variables on game launch (comma-separated list with variable names)
- Added: Multi-action support for custom buttons (it's now possible to let buttons execute multiple actions without using a button script)
 
- Reworked: Completely reworked Visibility Requirements
--> They are called "Loading Requirements" now, because the last months made them evolve into more than just visibility controllers (they handle tickers, audio elements, etc.)
--> You can now add multiple instances of the same requirement type to one element/layout
--> "Show If" and "Show If Not" requirement modes are now called "NORMAL" and "OPPOSITE"
--> Added Requirement Groups
----> Requirement groups can hold multiple requirements to basically make them one big requirement
----> Groups have two modes to control how they should handle their child requirements
------> In 'AND' mode, all of its requirements need to return TRUE for the group to return TRUE (which basically means "Yes, show this!")
------> In 'OR' mode, only one requirement needs to return TRUE for the group to return TRUE
--> New fancy GUIs to manage requirements!
 
- Reworked: Manage Actions GUI (when managing actions of buttons and tickers)
--> You can now re-order actions
--> You can now add new actions directly in the Manage Actions screen
 
- Improved: Most text inputs now open an in-game TEXT EDITOR to easily edit content
--> Especially useful when working with placeholders, since the text editor highlights them
 
- Fixed: Advanced sizing/positioning of custom buttons not correctly saving/loading in the layout editor
- Fixed: Text elements sometimes throwing errors due to getting updated asynchronously
- Fixed: Crash when pressing Done after rapidly clicking 'closegui' action in button action screen
- Fixed: Selected button action in Manage Actions screen can change when clicking on button in popup
- Fixed: Text Input Field element sometimes not correctly updating its content when its variable gets reset
- Fixed: Player element buttons to toggle crouching and nickname have the same tooltip
- Fixed: No warning in Save Layout screen when using bad/unsupported characters in layout name
- Fixed: Deleted/hidden Vanilla elements get visible again if a layout with them not deleted is loaded after the layout that deleted them
- Fixed: Hover label shows when hovering over disabled Vanilla buttons

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.13.3-2 for Forge 1.18+
 
- Fixed: Unable to launch game with ZeroCore installed, because FancyMenu always thinks the installed version is too old
 
- Changed: Lowered minimum required Forge versions of 1.18 and 1.19 (experimental; if possible, use the latest Forge build)

%changelog:end%





CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.13.3-1
 
- Compiled mod with latest Forge to try if it fixes the "Bad Access to Protected Data in GetField" crash
--> It's worth noting that this crash seems to not come from FancyMenu, but other mods (probably core mods)
    that were built using too old Forge builds. FancyMenu is just the mod that throws the error,
	because it happens in parts of FancyMenu's code.

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.13.1 for MC <1.19.3
 
- IMPORTANT: THIS IS ONLY A DUMMY UPDATE FOR 1.12 AND ADDS NOTHING THERE!
 
- Reworked: Player Entity Element (1.16+)
--> THIS IS ONLY FOR 1.16+!! 1.12 did not get this rework since I'm a bit tired of it tbh.. (But if you're willing to port it to 1.12, hit me with a PR and I will add it!)
--> The old element is now DEPRECATED and will be removed in the future, so it's recommended to redo your player entities using the new element
--> Player name now supports placeholders
--> Skin and cape URLs now fully support placeholders
--> Added new "Is Baby" option to make the player a baby
--> Added new "Parrot On Left Shoulder" option to choose which shoulder the parrot should sit on
--> You can now separately enable the "Auto Skin" and "Auto Cape" options to pick the skin based on the player name
--> There is now an actual toggle to enable/disable the "Copy Client Player" option that automatically picks the client player name, skin and cape

%changelog:end%





CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.13.1
 
- Added: Support for MC 1.19.3
 
- Reworked: Player Entity Element
--> I had to do this to make it work in 1.19.3, but I wanted to rework it anways, so I used the forced rework to modernize the element an add new stuff
--> Because the old element isn't working anymore in 1.19.3, you will sadly need to redo your player entity elements when updating to 1.19.3
--> The old element is now DEPRECATED in versions <1.19.3 and will be removed in the future, so it's recommended to redo your player entities using the new element
--> Player name now supports placeholders
--> Skin and cape URLs now fully support placeholders
--> Added new "Is Baby" option to make the player a baby
--> Added new "Parrot On Left Shoulder" option to choose which shoulder the parrot should sit on
--> You can now separately enable the "Auto Skin" and "Auto Cape" options to pick the skin based on the player name

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.13.0
 
- Dependency Change: Minimum required Konkrete version is 1.6.0 now
 
- Reworked: Text Placeholders
--> New system replaces old one! Old placeholders still work, but they are DEPRECATED now and will be removed in a future update!
--> It is really recommended to replace old placeholders with their new versions, since all the new features don't work for old ones.
--> New JSON-like syntax (Pseudo-JSON, not actual JSON)
--> Placeholders now support nesting! You can now use placeholders in values of other placeholders!
--> Syntax characters in values ( " { } ) can be escaped by putting a backslash ( \ ) before them
--> The old placeholder API is DEPRECATED as well now! Use the v2 PlaceholderRegistry instead (not in the 'api' package anymore)!
 
- Added: Config option to disable the red unicode warning that appears when using a unicode font
- Added: "Screen Width" placeholder to get the width of the current screen (this one's actually not new, but wasn't accessible via the placeholder menu before)
- Added: "Screen Height" placeholderto get the height of the current screen (this one's actually not new, but wasn't accessible via the placeholder menu before)
- Added: "Stringify" placeholder to escape syntax characters in its value
- Added: "Element Width" placeholder to get the width of an element by its element ID
- Added: "Element Height" placeholder to get the height of an element by its element ID
- Added: "Element X Position" placeholder to get the X position of an element by its element ID
- Added: "Element Y Position" placeholder to get the Y position of an element by its element ID
- Added: "Calculator" placeholder to solve arithmetic expressions
- Added: "Mouse X Position" placeholder to get the X position of the mouse cursor
- Added: "Mouse Y Position" placeholder to get the Y position of the mouse cursor

- Added: "Is Text" visibility requirement to compare a text with another one
--> Supports multiple compare modes: equals, contains, starts-with, ends-with
- Added: "Is Number" visibility requirement to compare a number with another one
--> Supports multiple compare modes: equals, bigger-than, smaller-than, bigger-than-or-equals, smaller-than-or-equals
- Added: "Is Element Hovered" visibility requirement to check if an element is hovered
--> Kinda replaces the old "Is Button Hovered" requirement, but old one can still be used
--> Checks hover-state based on the element's size, so some element's hover-states could be a little inaccurate due to its size being smaller than the actual element
- Added: Advanced Positioning for elements
--> Allows you to manually input X and Y positions for elements
--> Supports text placeholders to be used as value (combining this with the new calculator placeholder should give you A LOT of new things to do!)
- Added: Advanced Sizing for elements
--> Allows you to manually input width and height values for elements
--> Supports text placeholders to be used as value (combining this with the new calculator placeholder should give you A LOT of new things to do!)
- Added: "Ticker" element to execute actions (same as button actions) every tick
--> Can be set to tick asynchronously
--> Can run multiple actions
--> Allows you to set a tick delay (delay between ticks) in milliseconds
--> Can be set to tick only once every time you load the menu or only once per game session
- Added: Placeholder support to menu titles
 
- Improved: It's now possible to use placeholders in visibility requirement values
- Improved: Changed "Choose Layer" text in element right-click menu to "Pick Element", to be less confusing
- Improved: Auto-scaling now requires the user to set a forced GUI scale first
--> Layouts with auto-scaling already enabled will not change, but it's really recommend to set a forced GUI scale if you haven't yet
- Improved: New text elements now get added below the top menu bar instead of behind it
 
- Fixed: Some URLs containing '&' characters not working correctly
- Fixed: Placeholders not working in button action values
 
- Known Issue: Clicking on entries of the placeholder context menu in the visibility requirements screen clicks buttons behind the context menu

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.12.7
 
- Fixed:
 
This is a (better late than never) "hotfix" for the issues from 2 days ago, where an update to the official MC launcher
completely killed FancyMenu when using it with the CurseForge launcher.
This is currently not an issue anymore, because Mojang pulled the launcher update (probably because they broke their own logging with it),
but it can happen again soon, so I wanted to fix this just in case.
 
Since this fix is actually quite big and includes changing FancyMenu's file handling like everywhere,
it is absolutely possible that this fix created new bugs.
 
If you notice strange things like missing layouts, missing layout elements or anything else that saves/loads stuff to/from
your drive, please open a GitHub issue or post it in Discord (http://discord.keksuccino.com)! Thank you very much!

--> Text elements are now scrollable!
--> Set the base (HEX) text color
--> Text elements now kinda work like a display (they are resizeable and text gets rendered only inside the element area; they don't automatically resize anymore)
--> Direct text now supports multi-line by using "%n%" as line break
--> Customize the color and/or texture of the scroll grabber
--> Customize line spacing
--> Set elements to all-uppercase or all-lowercase (or normal)

- Fixed: [1.16+] Unable to open the Create World screen by using the /openguiscreen command

- Added: Visibility requirement "Is Real Time Week Day" to check for the current day of week (Week begins on sunday!)
- Added: Option to restart background animations when opening the menu (right-click editor background to access option)
 
- Changed: Description of the 'mimicbutton' button action (now way more detailed and explains how to get the button locator)
- Changed: Migrated all real-time visibility requirements to the new visibility requirement system

%changelog:end%

- Added: Button Layout Compatibility System
--> Prevents menu layouts from breaking when the Vanilla button layout changes due to a mod adding a button to the menu, etc.
--> I need to manually add support for every menu so that it can use this system, that's why it only works for the main menu, death screen and pause menu for now
 
- Fixed: Some death reasons break menu layouts for the death screen, because the positions of the buttons change

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.6.4-1 for MC 1.16+
 
- IMPORTANT: Everything related to the old menu audio system is now DEPRECATED and will be removed in the near future!
-- Instead, you will now need to download the new audio extension for FancyMenu, with new features and a better audio system
-- It's not possible anymore to add new audios using the old system, but you can still remove them (via Element -> Manage Audios)
 
- IMPORTANT: The new audio extension only supports OGG files, since it's now completely integrated into the MC sound engine, so you will need to convert your old WAV files
 
- Added: Support for the FancyMenu Audio Extension
-- FORGE: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/audio-extension-for-fancymenu-forge
-- FABRIC: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/audio-extension-for-fancymenu-fabric

- Removed: Placeholder text value '%servermotd:<server_ip>%' from the placeholder context menu in the editor
  - Placeholder still exists and works for already existing layouts, but can't be set to new layouts or when editing one (it's basically deprecated now)

- Lifted minimum required Konkrete version to 1.3.3
 
- Added: Button action 'mimicbutton' to mimic the button action of a Vanilla button
  - The action value is the button locator of the button
  - The button locator is a combination of the menu identifier of the menu the button is in and the ID of the button, separated by colon (menu_identifier:button_id)
- Added: Placeholder text value '%Vanillabuttonlabel:<button_locator>' to get the button label of a Vanilla button by its button locator (same thing as for the 'mimicbutton' button action)
- Added: "Reset Window Size Restrictions" button to the layout editor properties context menu, for easier resetting of window size restrictions
 
- Removed: Old deprecated animation system (old animations will not load anymore, please switch to the new animation system)

- Fixed: Optifine not counting to existing mods in '%loadedmods%' and '%totalmods%' placeholder text values
- Fixed: Web textures not loading when Optifine is installed

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.4.0
 
- Added: Button action support to the API to add your own custom button actions
- Added: Command 'openguiscreen' to open a Vanilla or custom GUI via command (Usage: /openguiscreen <identifier>)
- Added: Button action 'copytoclipboard' to copy a text to the system clipboard
- Added: 'Force Fullscreen' option to the FancyMenu settings to force the window to fullscreen on game start (users can still go out of fullscreen later)
- Added: Menu identifier compatibility system
  - Automatically detects outdated menu identifiers in layouts and loads the layout in the correct menu (as long as said identifier is in the identifier database and can be detected)
  - This will hopefully prevent most of the struggle when mod loader X decides to change the screen class names/mappings again (which will change menu identifiers)
  - WARNING: Now every layout for the same menu will be loaded in EVERY Minecraft version and mod loader, so if you have layouts for multiple versions enabled, they will stack now!
 
- Removed: Button actions 'prevbackground' and 'nextbackground', because they were just leftovers from older versions and had no function anymore
 
- Fixed: Missing warning notification when trying to set an image with unsupported file name characters as background image
- Fixed: 1.12: Wrong mod version string in mod metadata
- Fixed: Flashing pink "Missing Texture" images when rendering an animation with missing textures (duh)

  - Export and import FancyMenu setups with config, all of your layouts, animations, resources, etc.
  - Let FancyMenu automatically fix menu identifiers when importing setups from other MC versions or mod loaders
  - Setup sharing can be accessed via the "Setup" tab in the customization menu bar at the top edge of menu screens

- Improved: Unloaded web textures (no internet connection or not loaded yet) are now invisible in the actual menu and show as missing texture in the editor, to be able to edit them
 
- Fixed: Some elements that use external resources like textures and other files aren't working on other systems than Windows when using backslashes in the path
- Fixed: MC 1.12: Server-related placeholders and visibility requirements not working correctly








CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.3.5
 
- Added: New element orientation 'element'
  - Allows you to define "child elements" for an element, so the child elements will always follow the parent element
  - Useful when adding new buttons to a Vanilla button layout without giving every single button an orientation
  - Can be used to make element groups in the editor (just move the parent and all child elements will follow)
  - You need the element ID of the parent to set the 'element' orientation to an element
    - Right-click the parent element and click on "Copy Element ID" to copy its element id to your clipboard








CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.3.4
 
- Improved: It's now possible to customize overlapping buttons (like in the world creation screen)
 
- Fixed: Empty customization sections for Vanilla button visibility requirements getting added to the layout file








CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.3.3
 
- Fixed: Placeholder text value '%serverstatus:<server_IP>%' not working correctly (for real this time?)








CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.3.2
 
- Changed: Increased server ping interval for server-related actions (placeholder text values, etc.) from 15 to 30 seconds
 
- Fixed: Unable to set long file paths for button background images

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.3.1
 
- Fixed: Vanilla buttons still visible in real menu even if hidden/deleted in the layout
 
 
KNOWN ISSUES:
 
- Vanilla buttons don't listen to visibility requirement changes
- Sounds of animations used as button background are playing in the editor (animation sounds aren't supposed to play for button backgrounds)










CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.3.0
 
- Dropped support for MC 1.15
 
- Added support for Forge MC 1.17.1
 
- Lifted minimum required Konkrete version to 1.3.0
- Lifted minimum required Forge version for MC 1.12 to 14.23.5.2855
 
- IMPORTANT:
  Menu identifiers changed in MC 1.17 Forge! This means that many of your layouts will not load at the beginning, but don't panic, you can easily fix this.
  To get the new identifier of the menu you want to fix your layouts for, enable the "Menu Info" in the "Tools" tab of the menu bar at the
  top of the menu. Now you will see the identifier at the left side. You can left-click this identifier to copy it to the clipboard.
  Now open the '.minecraft/config/fancymenu/customization' folder and search for the layout you want to fix.
  Open this layout with a normal text editor and search for the 'identifier' value in the 'customization-meta' section (should be the first section).
  Change the identifier value after the equals sign to your new menu identifier.
  Now save the layout file and restart your game and the layout should load again!
 
- Added: Auto-Scaling for menus
  - ONLY FOR MC 1.16+ FOR NOW! It's just *really* difficult to add this feature to 1.12.. Don't know if I ever find a way to backport it.. :/
  - Just enable auto-scaling for a menu and your layout should basically just work at every scale and resolution! No more struggling with different screen sizes!
  - Because of how Minecraft text rendering works, text elements will look a bit blurry at some scales. This can't be fixed and the best workaround is to use images for text.
- Added: Visibility Requirements for elements (Port of the system used in FancyHud)
  - Set conditions that need to be met (or not met) for the element to be visible
- Added: Custom text localizations to register your own localizations for your text elements
- Added: Option to enable a grid in the editor for easier aligning of elements (Disabled by default, can be toggled in the FM settings)
  - Editor shortcut to toggle the grid is CTRL + G
- Added: Ability to keep the aspect ratio of menu backgrounds
- Added: Simplified Chinese localization (Big thanks to Draming and GBLodb!)
- Added: Placeholder text value 'local:<localization.key>' to localize a text by the given key
- Added: Placeholder text value '%percentram%' to get the currently used RAM in percent
- Added: Placeholder text value '%usedram%' to get the currently used RAM in MB
- Added: Placeholder text value '%maxram%' to get the max RAM in MB

- Added: Placeholder text value '%realtimeday%' to get the current real time day (system time)
- Added: Placeholder text value '%realtimehour%' to get the current real time hour (system time)
- Added: Placeholder text value '%realtimeminute%' to get the current real time minute (system time)
- Added: Placeholder text value '%realtimesecond%' to get the current real time second (system time)
- Added: Placeholder text value '%serverversion:<serverIP>%' to get the game version of a server by its IP
- Added: Placeholder text value '%serverstatus:<serverIP>%' to get the status (online/offline) of a server by its IP
- Added: Placeholder text value '%serverplayercount:<serverIP>%' to get the current player count of a server by its IP
- Added: Placeholder text value '%serverping:<serverIP>%' to get the ping to a server by its IP
- Added: Placeholder text value '%servermotd:<serverIP>%' to get the MOTD (message of the day) of a server by its IP
 
- Changed: Removed "Reset Clicksound" option for Vanilla and custom buttons (Now you can remove the sound just by setting and empty sound path)
- Changed: Removed "Reset Hoversound" option for Vanilla and custom buttons (Now you can remove the sound just by setting and empty sound path)
- Changed: Editor now saves all customizations for Vanilla buttons even if they are hidden/deleted
- Changed: Reworked button background system
  - Added support for GIFs and animations to be set as background
  - The system no longer needs both normal and hover background to be set (one is enough)
  - It's possible to set different types of backgrounds for normal and hover (e.g. image as normal background and animation as hover background)
  - Option to set if the background animations should restart on hover
  - Option to set if the background animations should loop
 
- Fixed: Action IDs for custom buttons not getting loaded into the editor correctly
- Fixed: Text of current menu glitching through loading/splash screen background in MC 1.16+
- Fixed: "Not Supported" error when trying to open the resource pack menu via the 'opengui' button action
