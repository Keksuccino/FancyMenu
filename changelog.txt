- Fixed Custom GUIs showing their identifier as title if no title was set
- Fixed Custom GUIs not correctly applying some of the settings configured in the Build/Edit Custom GUI screen

- The "Custom Screen Title" entry in the editor is now disabled for Custom GUIs, since it doesn't work for them anyways
- The "Header/Footer Customizations" entry in the editor is now disabled for Custom GUIs, since Custom GUIs don't have headers/footers
- Reduced amount of sub-menus to set a button/slider background/handle texture
- Improved the rotation logic of cubic panoramas (they should now not randomly speed up anymore, but you maybe need to adjust your panorama's speed if it is too slow/fast now)

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.0.6
 
- Fixed wrong mod version for Fabric builds (was stuck at 3.0.3; gradle script should now set correct version)
- Fixed background of CreateWorldScreen not customizable in some MC versions

- Fixed some mod incompatibilities related to how FancyMenu handles screens with tab navigation bars
  - This should fix the incompatibility with MidnightLib that caused ModMenu to freeze/crash in some situations
- Added option to toggle if Custom GUIs should pause the game while in a world

%changelog:end%

--> This could fix some crashes caused by mods that add custom chat colors and similar text-formatting-related stuff

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.0.0 - The "Don't Panic, Your Layouts Still Work" Update
 
IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ!
 
Most layouts should still work fine, but some very deprecated stuff (and the Audio element of the extension)
got removed, so there will be some special cases where you need to fix some parts.
 
The following changelog only contains SOME of the maaaany changes in FancyMenu v3.
It's just too much stuff to mention every change in detail.
It's also very likely that I forgot some of the bigger changes, because I worked on v3 for over 8 months.
In these 8+ months I rewrote like 90% of the code (some parts multiple times), shared progress updates with
you all and got a lot of feedback from you to polish as many of the new/rewritten stuff as possible!
 
Thank you SO MUCH to all of the Alpha and Beta testers and people who made suggestions for v3!
This update wouldn't be possible without you! <3
 
But well, since sooo much stuff got rewritten in this update, there's like no chance it will not contain bugs and some of them
could harm your layouts, so please make sure to BACKUP YOUR LAYOUTS AND MINECRAFT INSTANCE before updating to this version!
 
And now have fun reading that frickin book, uhm I mean changelog!
 
tl;dr: BACKUP your LAYOUTS and Minecraft INSTANCE before updating!
 
------------------------------
 
- The new wiki for v3: docs.keksuccino.net
 
- FancyMenu v3 is available for 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.20.1, 1.20.4 and future Minecraft versions (all other versions not listed here get dropped with v3)
 
- Old Audio elements from the Audio extension don't work anymore, you need to add the new Audio element of the base mod (sorry)
 
- Old v2 layouts, variables, custom GUIs and other things get CONVERTED to v3, so there's no going back to v2 after loading your setuo in v3!
--> Make sure to backup your setup before loading it in v3!
 
- Button tooltips (custom and Vanilla buttons) now look like Vanilla ones
- Button tooltips will not jump to the complete opposite site of the mouse cursor anymore when hitting the edge of the screen
- If "Preserve Background Aspect Ratio" is enabled, menu backgrounds will now always get rendered with the correct aspect ratio, no matter how big/small the screen is
- Orientations are now called "Anchor Points"
- You can now use all customizable Vanilla elements of menus as base for the "Element" anchor point (was only Vanilla buttons before)
- All assets (textures, sounds, etc.) now need to be in "config/fancymenu/assets" (old assets still work, but new ones need to be in the assets dir)
- Variables now get saved in a new format (Old variables get converted to the new format, but you need to enable "Reset on Launch" again, because the config option for it no longer exists)
- New elements now stay on screen by default (they never go out of screen by resizing the window or changing the GUI scale; this can be disabled per-element)
- New elements now have "mid-centered" as default anchor point
- When adding a new element by using the right-click context menu, the new element will now get added at the spot where you've opened the context menu
- Custom window icon system now allows you to set your own icon paths (You will need to set your custom icons again and move them to /config/fancymenu/assets/)
- You don't need to restart the game anymore after changing the custom window icon(s) (gets updated automatically)
- You don't need to restart the game anymore after changing the custom window title (gets updated automatically)
- The "/openguiscreen" and "/closeguiscreen" commands now accept a player argument to remotely open/close GUIs for other players (OP permissions needed)
- The "/openguiscreen" and "/closeguiscreen" commands can now be executed from console (as non-player) by setting a player argument
- The "/fmvariable" command now supports setting values with spaces, quotation marks and backslashes
- Completely reworked all APIs and registries (so if you've used these in an extension mod, this mod is broken now, sorry >.<)
- Most UI stuff got a full rewrite (context menus, menu bars, screens, etc.)
- FancyMenu's settings are now part of the menu bar at the top of menu screens and should be way easier to navigate through now
- The header and footer textures of scrollable screens (like Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Video Settings, etc.) are now customizable
- It's now possible to set an inactive background for buttons (inactive means greyed out and not clickable)
- There's a short placeholder format for variables now: $$variable_name
- The action system now supports IF, ELSE-IF und ELSE statements (IF and ELSE-IF take loading requirements)
- You can drag-&-drop actions (and statements) in the "Edit Actions" screen now (to move them)
- Complex loading requirements like "Is Number" now have a GUI to build/edit their values more easily
- Complex actions like "Execute Terminal/CMD Command" now have a GUI to build/edit their values more easily
- FancyMenu's "config.txt" file is now called "options.txt" (It's NOT recommended to rename the old one to "options.txt"!)
--> This also means everything from the old config needs to get set again (like custom window title, window icon, etc.) (sorry for that!)
- The pose of Player Entity elements is now fully customizable (Every body part can be rotated on its X, Y and Z axis, except base body/torso, which only rotates on X and Y)
- Player Entity elements now have separate "follow mouse" toggles for head and body
- Player Entity elements now keep their customized pose while "follow mouse" is enabled
- Player Entity elements now have full placeholder support for pose (all body part rotations) and scale
- Most screens now have shorter, universal identifiers (no too.long.identifiers.nobody.can.read anymore!)
- Universal identifiers (previously known as "compatibility identifiers") for buttons are now shorter (there's no "button_compatibility_id:" prefix anymore)
- All elements of the Progress Screen are now customizable
- All elements of the Level Loading Screen are now customizable
- All elements of the Receiving Level Screen are now customizable
- All elements of the Connect Screen are now customizable
- It is now possible to set a serialized text component (like in the '/tellraw' command for example) as label for buttons and as text for Splash Text elements
- The "Execute Terminal/CMD Command" action now prints its process output to the game log
- There's now a layout index system to customize the loading order of multi-layout setups (multiple layouts for the same menu)
- The old overlay to show the screen identifier got replaced with a full debug overlay that shows useful information about performance, loaded layouts and more
- You can now fully customize Vanilla/Mod Slider handle and background textures
- The Image menu background type now supports web sources (and allows you to set a local fallback texture in case the web source fails to load)
- It's now possible to set GIF images as menu background
- Text elements are now locked at a maximum of 45,000 characters, because the game isn't really usable anymore when using longer texts
- The placeholder parser is now locked at a maximum of 17,000 characters per text that can be checked for placeholders
--> So if you use placeholders in text elements, this overrides the normal 45,000 characters maximum
- Universal layouts now get always loaded BEFORE normal ones, so normal layouts can override parts of universal ones
- The grid in the layout editor now always gets rendered at the same scale, no matter what GUI scale is used
- FancyMenu now supports APNG textures (Animated PNGs, like GIFs, but better)
- It is now possible to pre-load specific resources
--> Accessible via Customization Menu Bar -> Customization -> Pre-Load Resources
--> Recommended for APNGs used as game intro

- Backported Vanilla 1.19.4+ widget label rendering (sliding left to right) to 1.18.2 and 1.19.2
- Panoramas should now load when its properties file name is "properties.txt.txt" (you know why)
- Slideshows should now load when its properties file name is "properties.txt.txt" (you know why)
 
- Animations are now deprecated!
--> APNGs exist now (and maybe videos soon), so there's no real need for animations anymore
--> It's not possible to add new Animation elements to layouts, but existing ones still work for now
--> Animations can't get set as game intro anymore, but existing animation intros still work for now
--> Animations can't get set as button background anymore, but existing animation button backgrounds still work for now
--> Animations can't get set as menu background anymore, but existing animation menu background still work for now

--> Toggle the text shadow of all of FancyMenu's UI text
--> Toggle the click sound of all of FancyMenu's UI elements
--> FancyMenu's UI Scale is now "Auto" by default (automatically shows the UI at scale 2 instead of 1 if the window is bigger than 1920x1080)
 
- The Layout Editor got a full rewrite
--> Better menu navigation
--> Added an anchor point overlay that shows the anchor of elements and lets you set the anchor of elements by hovering over an anchor
--> You can now move multiple elements at the same time with the mouse by holding CTRL (was only possible by using the arrow keys before)
--> Replaced "moving/dragging not allowed" message when moving an element with indicator that tells you the element in not moveable
--> You can now draw a mouse selection rectangle to select multiple elements
--> There's a "Layer" widget now that lets you easily reorder elements (and it lets you rename elements!)
--> Removed the delete confirmation for elements, because undo/redo exists
 
- Reworked Text elements
--> Text elements now have auto line wrapping/breaking (toggleable; enabled by default)
--> There's now full markdown support for web and local text sources
--> Special markdown formatting code to colorize text parts with HEX colors
--> Special markdown formatting codes to make text parts centered or right-sided

--> To get the current value of a Slider for use in its loading requirements and actions, use $$value as placeholder
--> Sliders now have 3 modes: List (pre-defined value list), Integer Range (range of whole numbers) and Decimal Range (range of decimals)
--> Just like Vanilla Sliders, custom ones have fully customizable textures now (handle and background)
--> Old Slider elements are deprecated now
 
- Reworked Audio elements
--> Their options got simplified while keeping all features of the old version
--> They now have a detailed memory of what tracks they already played, so even in Shuffle mode they only play every audio once per loop (or once in total if not looping)
--> They never play the same track twice in a row (well except they only have one track)
--> The logic of when Audio elements keep playing across menus is more in line with the rest of FM now, so Audio elements only keep playing across menus if they are part of a universal layout now
--> The Manage Tracks GUI lets you easily reorder tracks to let them play in the correct order (if not in Shuffle)
--> They support WEB audio sources now!
--> Oh and they are part of the BASE MOD now! No Audio extension anymore!
 
- Reworked Custom GUIs
--> OLD SCREEN OVERRIDES DON'T WORK ANYMORE! You need to override screens again (sorry >.<)
--> They should now be way more stable and shouldn't cause so many issues anymore
--> Custom GUIs can now be managed more easily (custom GUI controls are now located in the "Customization" tab of the menu bar)
--> Overriding Vanilla/Mod screens should be more stable now and there's now a menu where you can see and manage (delete) all overridden screens
 
- Removed deprecated (old) text element and web text element (this does not affect the new text element added in FancyMenu v2.12.0)
- Removed deprecated background audio feature of layouts, since the Audio Extension is a thing now (install the extension mod and add an Audio element to the layout)
- Removed deprecated feature to use the localization key/label of a Vanilla button to identify it (this was an _ancient_ thing and was probably unused zombie code for like 2-3 years)
- Removed deprecated 'prevbackground' and 'nextbackground' actions (leftover of ancient menu background handling; wasn't really functional anymore in modern layouts)
- Removed deprecated 'opencustomgui' action, because 'opengui' can open custom GUIs for a long time now
- Removed deprecated (old) placeholder system (the old ones that looked like %placeholder%, not the new JSON-like ones)
- Removed legacy "Required Mods" option of layouts, since loading requirements can be used for that instead
- Removed legacy "Maximum/Minimum Minecraft Version" option of layouts, since loading requirements can be used for that instead
- Removed legacy "Maximum/Minimum FancyMenu Version" option of layouts, since loading requirements can be used for that instead
- Removed legacy "Screen Height/Width Requirements" option of layouts, since loading requirements can be used for that instead
- Removed legacy "Only In Multiplayer/Singleplayer" options of button elements, because loading requirements can be used for that instead
- Removed customizability of the Vanilla Splash Text element in the Title Screen, because you can simply add a custom one and set it to Vanilla mode
- Removed config options to toggle the visibility of the percentage and chunk elements of the Level Loading Screen (these are now customizable in the layout editor)
 
- Fixed: Probably a lot of bugs that were caused by old spaghetti code (and probably added the same amount of new bugs)
- Fixed: MC 1.19.4+: Vanilla buttons that got moved or resized flicker when resizing some screens like the Create World screen
- Fixed: Button tooltips sometimes sticking to next menu screen
- Fixed: Copyright button is deletable (you can't delete or resize it anymore, but moving still works as long as the button stays on-screen)
- Fixed: Resizing not working correctly when using the "Element" anchor point
- Fixed: Element-Info (X-pos, Y-pos, width, etc.) at the side of elements in the editor can go off-screen when the element is too far right or at the top
- Fixed: Incompatibility with "Remove Reloading Screen" mod
- Fixed: Minecraft's "/help" command doesn't work correctly for FancyMenu's "/fmvariable" command
- Fixed: "&" formatting codes in "Paste to Chat" action get replaced with "§" formatting codes
- Fixed: "&" formatting codes in "Send Message" action get replaced with "§" formatting codes
- Fixed: Crash when pressing DELETE on an empty line in the text editor
- Fixed: It is possible to remove/reset the Forced GUI Scale of a layout without disabling Auto-Scaling first, which can lead to the layout scaling the menu to infinity
- Fixed: Panoramas sometimes not loading properly (not showing up in panorama menu)

- Fixed: Fabric: Buttons added by other mods (like Mod Menu's "Mods" button) act weird (they get duplicated, etc.)
 
- Improved: Further improved handling of Minecraft 1.19.4's new screen init behaviour
 
 
 
CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.14.1
 
- Fixed: Text elements don't render in Drippy Loading Screen
- Fixed: Unable to open Resource Pack Screen via 'opengui' action in some MC versions
- Fixed: Very rare bug related to a task executor that caused a NullPointer error spam in the log
- Fixed: MC 1.12: Scroll grabber of text elements is invisible when setting a grabber texture
 
- Changed: Disabled customizations for GUIs of "Screenshot Viewer" mod, because it caused crashes
 
 
 
CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.14.0
 
- Added: Ukrainian translation by BurrConnie (Thank you!)
- Added: Russian translation by dardRus (Thank you!)
- Added: Config option to reset specific variables on game launch (comma-separated list with variable names)
- Added: Multi-action support for custom buttons (it's now possible to let buttons execute multiple actions without using a button script)
 
- Reworked: Completely reworked Visibility Requirements
--> They are called "Loading Requirements" now, because the last months made them evolve into more than just visibility controllers (they handle tickers, audio elements, etc.)
--> You can now add multiple instances of the same requirement type to one element/layout
--> "Show If" and "Show If Not" requirement modes are now called "NORMAL" and "OPPOSITE"
--> Added Requirement Groups
----> Requirement groups can hold multiple requirements to basically make them one big requirement
----> Groups have two modes to control how they should handle their child requirements
------> In 'AND' mode, all of its requirements need to return TRUE for the group to return TRUE (which basically means "Yes, show this!")
------> In 'OR' mode, only one requirement needs to return TRUE for the group to return TRUE
--> New fancy GUIs to manage requirements!
 
- Reworked: Manage Actions GUI (when managing actions of buttons and tickers)
--> You can now re-order actions
--> You can now add new actions directly in the Manage Actions screen
 
- Improved: Most text inputs now open an in-game TEXT EDITOR to easily edit content
--> Especially useful when working with placeholders, since the text editor highlights them
 
- Fixed: Advanced sizing/positioning of custom buttons not correctly saving/loading in the layout editor
- Fixed: Text elements sometimes throwing errors due to getting updated asynchronously
- Fixed: Crash when pressing Done after rapidly clicking 'closegui' action in button action screen
- Fixed: Selected button action in Manage Actions screen can change when clicking on button in popup
- Fixed: Text Input Field element sometimes not correctly updating its content when its variable gets reset
- Fixed: Player element buttons to toggle crouching and nickname have the same tooltip
- Fixed: No warning in Save Layout screen when using bad/unsupported characters in layout name
- Fixed: Deleted/hidden Vanilla elements get visible again if a layout with them not deleted is loaded after the layout that deleted them
- Fixed: Hover label shows when hovering over disabled Vanilla buttons
- Fixed: Hover sound plays when hovering over disabled Vanilla buttons
- Fixed: MC formatting codes (color, bold, etc.) sometimes not working in placeholders

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.13.3-2 for Forge 1.18+
 
- Fixed: Unable to launch game with ZeroCore installed, because FancyMenu always thinks the installed version is too old
 
- Changed: Lowered minimum required Forge versions of 1.18 and 1.19 (experimental; if possible, use the latest Forge build)

%changelog:end%





CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.13.3-1
 
- Compiled mod with latest Forge to try if it fixes the "Bad Access to Protected Data in GetField" crash
--> It's worth noting that this crash seems to not come from FancyMenu, but other mods (probably core mods)
    that were built using too old Forge builds. FancyMenu is just the mod that throws the error,
	because it happens in parts of FancyMenu's code.

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.13.1 for MC <1.19.3
 
- IMPORTANT: THIS IS ONLY A DUMMY UPDATE FOR 1.12 AND ADDS NOTHING THERE!
 
- Reworked: Player Entity Element (1.16+)
--> THIS IS ONLY FOR 1.16+!! 1.12 did not get this rework since I'm a bit tired of it tbh.. (But if you're willing to port it to 1.12, hit me with a PR and I will add it!)
--> The old element is now DEPRECATED and will be removed in the future, so it's recommended to redo your player entities using the new element
--> Player name now supports placeholders
--> Skin and cape URLs now fully support placeholders
--> Added new "Is Baby" option to make the player a baby
--> Added new "Parrot On Left Shoulder" option to choose which shoulder the parrot should sit on
--> You can now separately enable the "Auto Skin" and "Auto Cape" options to pick the skin based on the player name
--> There is now an actual toggle to enable/disable the "Copy Client Player" option that automatically picks the client player name, skin and cape

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.13.1
 
- Added: Support for MC 1.19.3
 
- Reworked: Player Entity Element
--> I had to do this to make it work in 1.19.3, but I wanted to rework it anways, so I used the forced rework to modernize the element an add new stuff
--> Because the old element isn't working anymore in 1.19.3, you will sadly need to redo your player entity elements when updating to 1.19.3
--> The old element is now DEPRECATED in versions <1.19.3 and will be removed in the future, so it's recommended to redo your player entities using the new element
--> Player name now supports placeholders
--> Skin and cape URLs now fully support placeholders
--> Added new "Is Baby" option to make the player a baby
--> Added new "Parrot On Left Shoulder" option to choose which shoulder the parrot should sit on
--> You can now separately enable the "Auto Skin" and "Auto Cape" options to pick the skin based on the player name

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.13.0
 
- Dependency Change: Minimum required Konkrete version is 1.6.0 now
 
- Reworked: Text Placeholders
--> New system replaces old one! Old placeholders still work, but they are DEPRECATED now and will be removed in a future update!
--> It is really recommended to replace old placeholders with their new versions, since all the new features don't work for old ones.
--> New JSON-like syntax (Pseudo-JSON, not actual JSON)
--> Placeholders now support nesting! You can now use placeholders in values of other placeholders!
--> Syntax characters in values ( " { } ) can be escaped by putting a backslash ( \ ) before them
--> The old placeholder API is DEPRECATED as well now! Use the v2 PlaceholderRegistry instead (not in the 'api' package anymore)!
 
- Added: Config option to disable the red unicode warning that appears when using a unicode font
- Added: "Screen Width" placeholder to get the width of the current screen (this one's actually not new, but wasn't accessible via the placeholder menu before)
- Added: "Screen Height" placeholderto get the height of the current screen (this one's actually not new, but wasn't accessible via the placeholder menu before)
- Added: "Stringify" placeholder to escape syntax characters in its value
- Added: "Element Width" placeholder to get the width of an element by its element ID
- Added: "Element Height" placeholder to get the height of an element by its element ID
- Added: "Element X Position" placeholder to get the X position of an element by its element ID
- Added: "Element Y Position" placeholder to get the Y position of an element by its element ID
- Added: "Calculator" placeholder to solve arithmetic expressions
- Added: "Mouse X Position" placeholder to get the X position of the mouse cursor
- Added: "Mouse Y Position" placeholder to get the Y position of the mouse cursor
- Added: "GUI Scale" placeholder to get the GUI scale (duh)
- Added: "Is Text" visibility requirement to compare a text with another one
--> Supports multiple compare modes: equals, contains, starts-with, ends-with
- Added: "Is Number" visibility requirement to compare a number with another one
--> Supports multiple compare modes: equals, bigger-than, smaller-than, bigger-than-or-equals, smaller-than-or-equals
- Added: "Is Element Hovered" visibility requirement to check if an element is hovered
--> Kinda replaces the old "Is Button Hovered" requirement, but old one can still be used
--> Checks hover-state based on the element's size, so some element's hover-states could be a little inaccurate due to its size being smaller than the actual element
- Added: Advanced Positioning for elements
--> Allows you to manually input X and Y positions for elements
--> Supports text placeholders to be used as value (combining this with the new calculator placeholder should give you A LOT of new things to do!)
- Added: Advanced Sizing for elements
--> Allows you to manually input width and height values for elements
--> Supports text placeholders to be used as value (combining this with the new calculator placeholder should give you A LOT of new things to do!)
- Added: "Ticker" element to execute actions (same as button actions) every tick
--> Can be set to tick asynchronously
--> Can run multiple actions
--> Allows you to set a tick delay (delay between ticks) in milliseconds
--> Can be set to tick only once every time you load the menu or only once per game session
- Added: Placeholder support to menu titles
 
- Improved: It's now possible to use placeholders in visibility requirement values
- Improved: Changed "Choose Layer" text in element right-click menu to "Pick Element", to be less confusing
- Improved: Auto-scaling now requires the user to set a forced GUI scale first
--> Layouts with auto-scaling already enabled will not change, but it's really recommend to set a forced GUI scale if you haven't yet
- Improved: New text elements now get added below the top menu bar instead of behind it
 
- Fixed: Some URLs containing '&' characters not working correctly
- Fixed: Placeholders not working in button action values
 
- Known Issue: Clicking on entries of the placeholder context menu in the visibility requirements screen clicks buttons behind the context menu

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.12.7
 
- Fixed:
 
This is a (better late than never) "hotfix" for the issues from 2 days ago, where an update to the official MC launcher
completely killed FancyMenu when using it with the CurseForge launcher.
This is currently not an issue anymore, because Mojang pulled the launcher update (probably because they broke their own logging with it),
but it can happen again soon, so I wanted to fix this just in case.
 
Since this fix is actually quite big and includes changing FancyMenu's file handling like everywhere,
it is absolutely possible that this fix created new bugs.
 
If you notice strange things like missing layouts, missing layout elements or anything else that saves/loads stuff to/from
your drive, please open a GitHub issue or post it in Discord (http://discord.keksuccino.com)! Thank you very much!

--> Text elements are now scrollable!
--> Set the base (HEX) text color
--> Text elements now kinda work like a display (they are resizeable and text gets rendered only inside the element area; they don't automatically resize anymore)
--> Direct text now supports multi-line by using "%n%" as line break

- Fixed: Vanilla-like splash text not correctly picking random text on game start
- Fixed: Commands not working when connected to a server (as client)
--> You can now use all commands on servers, even if the server does not have FancyMenu installed (FM is client-only and can't get loaded on servers anyways)

--> The title is the little headline of menus like the pause screen
--> To use, right-click the editor background and click on "Edit Menu Title" or "Reset Menu Title"
--> This will most probably not work for all menus and if that's the case, there's nothing you or I can do to fix it
- Added: Visibility requirement "Is Real Time Week Day" to check for the current day of week (Week begins on sunday!)
- Added: Option to restart background animations when opening the menu (right-click editor background to access option)
 
- Changed: Description of the 'mimicbutton' button action (now way more detailed and explains how to get the button locator)
- Changed: Migrated all real-time visibility requirements to the new visibility requirement system
--> IMPORTANT: This change breaks elements and layouts using these requirements! You will need to set these requirements again, sorry.
 
- Fixed: Animations not restarting when opening a menu while in-game (in a world/on a server)
- Fixed: Vanilla button animation background not restarting on first hover after opening/resizing the menu
- Fixed: [1.12] Mouse cursor invisible when opening menu via /openguiscreen command

%changelog:end%






CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.7.1
 
- Added: Button Layout Compatibility System
--> Prevents menu layouts from breaking when the Vanilla button layout changes due to a mod adding a button to the menu, etc.
--> I need to manually add support for every menu so that it can use this system, that's why it only works for the main menu, death screen and pause menu for now
 
- Fixed: Some death reasons break menu layouts for the death screen, because the positions of the buttons change

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.6.4-1 for MC 1.16+
 
- IMPORTANT: Everything related to the old menu audio system is now DEPRECATED and will be removed in the near future!
-- Instead, you will now need to download the new audio extension for FancyMenu, with new features and a better audio system
-- It's not possible anymore to add new audios using the old system, but you can still remove them (via Element -> Manage Audios)
 
- IMPORTANT: The new audio extension only supports OGG files, since it's now completely integrated into the MC sound engine, so you will need to convert your old WAV files
 
- Added: Support for the FancyMenu Audio Extension
-- FORGE: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/audio-extension-for-fancymenu-forge
-- FABRIC: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/audio-extension-for-fancymenu-fabric
 
- Removed: Config option to stop world music when in a customizable menu (a very similar option is now part of the audio extension)

%changelog:end%







CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.6.4

  - Check for bigger than X, smaller than X and equals X
  - Combine multiple scale conditions to check for a range of scales
 
- Improved: Mimic button system now uses the button from the current screen instance if the button to mimic is from the same screen type
 
- Removed: Placeholder text value '%servermotd:<server_ip>%' from the placeholder context menu in the editor
  - Placeholder still exists and works for already existing layouts, but can't be set to new layouts or when editing one (it's basically deprecated now)

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.5.0
 
- Lifted minimum required Konkrete version to 1.3.3
 
- Added: Button action 'mimicbutton' to mimic the button action of a Vanilla button
  - The action value is the button locator of the button
  - The button locator is a combination of the menu identifier of the menu the button is in and the ID of the button, separated by colon (menu_identifier:button_id)
- Added: Placeholder text value '%Vanillabuttonlabel:<button_locator>' to get the button label of a Vanilla button by its button locator (same thing as for the 'mimicbutton' button action)
- Added: "Reset Window Size Restrictions" button to the layout editor properties context menu, for easier resetting of window size restrictions
 
- Removed: Old deprecated animation system (old animations will not load anymore, please switch to the new animation system)
 
- Fixed: Visibility requirement "Is Mod Loaded" unable to check for Optifine (you can now check for mod ID 'optifine')
- Fixed: Optifine not counting to existing mods in '%loadedmods%' and '%totalmods%' placeholder text values
- Fixed: Web textures not loading when Optifine is installed
- Fixed: FPS drops in customized menus when many mods are installed (caused by placeholder text value)

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.4.3-1 for Forge 1.12

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.4.2
 
- NEW LICENSE! Builds before v2.4.2 are not affected by this and remain with the old license.

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.4.0
 
- Added: Button action support to the API to add your own custom button actions
- Added: Command 'openguiscreen' to open a Vanilla or custom GUI via command (Usage: /openguiscreen <identifier>)
- Added: Button action 'copytoclipboard' to copy a text to the system clipboard
- Added: 'Force Fullscreen' option to the FancyMenu settings to force the window to fullscreen on game start (users can still go out of fullscreen later)
- Added: Menu identifier compatibility system
  - Automatically detects outdated menu identifiers in layouts and loads the layout in the correct menu (as long as said identifier is in the identifier database and can be detected)
  - This will hopefully prevent most of the struggle when mod loader X decides to change the screen class names/mappings again (which will change menu identifiers)
  - WARNING: Now every layout for the same menu will be loaded in EVERY Minecraft version and mod loader, so if you have layouts for multiple versions enabled, they will stack now!
 
- Removed: Button actions 'prevbackground' and 'nextbackground', because they were just leftovers from older versions and had no function anymore
 
- Fixed: Missing warning notification when trying to set an image with unsupported file name characters as background image
- Fixed: 1.12: Wrong mod version string in mod metadata
- Fixed: Flashing pink "Missing Texture" images when rendering an animation with missing textures (duh)

- Fixed: Setup Sharing: 'pack.mcmeta' file of animation resource packs doesn't get exported correctly

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.3.7
 
- FancyMenu now has its own categories on CurseForge!
  - Use the Customization -> FancyMenu category for FancyMenu setups
  - Use the Mods -> FancyMenu category for FancyMenu extensions
 
- Added: Setup Sharing (HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL!! BACKUP YOUR MC INSTANCE BEFORE USING THIS!)
  - Export and import FancyMenu setups with config, all of your layouts, animations, resources, etc.
  - Let FancyMenu automatically fix menu identifiers when importing setups from other MC versions or mod loaders
  - Setup sharing can be accessed via the "Setup" tab in the customization menu bar at the top edge of menu screens








CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.3.6
 
- Added: FancyMenu API

- Improved: Web textures now load completely async and don't freeze menus anymore
- Improved: No more log error spam when loading layouts with web textures while not connected to the internet
- Improved: Web textures now keep their sizes when the layout gets saved in the editor without an active internet connection
- Improved: Unloaded web textures (no internet connection or not loaded yet) are now invisible in the actual menu and show as missing texture in the editor, to be able to edit them
 
- Fixed: Some elements that use external resources like textures and other files aren't working on other systems than Windows when using backslashes in the path
- Fixed: MC 1.12: Server-related placeholders and visibility requirements not working correctly








CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.3.5
 
- Added: New element orientation 'element'
  - Allows you to define "child elements" for an element, so the child elements will always follow the parent element
  - Useful when adding new buttons to a Vanilla button layout without giving every single button an orientation
  - Can be used to make element groups in the editor (just move the parent and all child elements will follow)
  - You need the element ID of the parent to set the 'element' orientation to an element
    - Right-click the parent element and click on "Copy Element ID" to copy its element id to your clipboard








CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.3.4
 
- Improved: It's now possible to customize overlapping buttons (like in the world creation screen)
 
- Fixed: Empty customization sections for Vanilla button visibility requirements getting added to the layout file








CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.3.3
 
- Fixed: Placeholder text value '%serverstatus:<server_IP>%' not working correctly (for real this time?)








CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.3.2
 
- Changed: Increased server ping interval for server-related actions (placeholder text values, etc.) from 15 to 30 seconds
 
- Fixed: Unable to set long file paths for button background images
- Fixed: Sounds of animations used as button background are playing in the editor
- Fixed: Vanilla buttons don't listen to visibility requirement changes
- Fixed: Crash when trying to add a button tooltip
- Fixed: Placeholder text value %serverstatus% not working correctly









CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.3.1
 
- Fixed: Vanilla buttons still visible in real menu even if hidden/deleted in the layout
 
 
KNOWN ISSUES:
 
- Vanilla buttons don't listen to visibility requirement changes
- Sounds of animations used as button background are playing in the editor (animation sounds aren't supposed to play for button backgrounds)










CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v2.3.0
 
- Dropped support for MC 1.15
 
- Added support for Forge MC 1.17.1
 
- Lifted minimum required Konkrete version to 1.3.0
- Lifted minimum required Forge version for MC 1.12 to 14.23.5.2855
 
- IMPORTANT:
  Menu identifiers changed in MC 1.17 Forge! This means that many of your layouts will not load at the beginning, but don't panic, you can easily fix this.
  To get the new identifier of the menu you want to fix your layouts for, enable the "Menu Info" in the "Tools" tab of the menu bar at the
  top of the menu. Now you will see the identifier at the left side. You can left-click this identifier to copy it to the clipboard.
  Now open the '.minecraft/config/fancymenu/customization' folder and search for the layout you want to fix.
  Open this layout with a normal text editor and search for the 'identifier' value in the 'customization-meta' section (should be the first section).
  Change the identifier value after the equals sign to your new menu identifier.
  Now save the layout file and restart your game and the layout should load again!
 
- Added: Auto-Scaling for menus
  - ONLY FOR MC 1.16+ FOR NOW! It's just *really* difficult to add this feature to 1.12.. Don't know if I ever find a way to backport it.. :/
  - Just enable auto-scaling for a menu and your layout should basically just work at every scale and resolution! No more struggling with different screen sizes!
  - Because of how Minecraft text rendering works, text elements will look a bit blurry at some scales. This can't be fixed and the best workaround is to use images for text.
- Added: Visibility Requirements for elements (Port of the system used in FancyHud)
  - Set conditions that need to be met (or not met) for the element to be visible
- Added: Custom text localizations to register your own localizations for your text elements
- Added: Option to enable a grid in the editor for easier aligning of elements (Disabled by default, can be toggled in the FM settings)
  - Editor shortcut to toggle the grid is CTRL + G
- Added: Ability to keep the aspect ratio of menu backgrounds
- Added: Simplified Chinese localization (Big thanks to Draming and GBLodb!)
- Added: Placeholder text value 'local:<localization.key>' to localize a text by the given key
- Added: Placeholder text value '%percentram%' to get the currently used RAM in percent
- Added: Placeholder text value '%usedram%' to get the currently used RAM in MB
- Added: Placeholder text value '%maxram%' to get the max RAM in MB
- Added: Placeholder text value '%realtimeyear%' to get the current real time year (system time)
- Added: Placeholder text value '%realtimemonth%' to get the current real time month (system time)
- Added: Placeholder text value '%realtimeday%' to get the current real time day (system time)
- Added: Placeholder text value '%realtimehour%' to get the current real time hour (system time)
- Added: Placeholder text value '%realtimeminute%' to get the current real time minute (system time)
- Added: Placeholder text value '%realtimesecond%' to get the current real time second (system time)
- Added: Placeholder text value '%serverversion:<serverIP>%' to get the game version of a server by its IP
- Added: Placeholder text value '%serverstatus:<serverIP>%' to get the status (online/offline) of a server by its IP
- Added: Placeholder text value '%serverplayercount:<serverIP>%' to get the current player count of a server by its IP
- Added: Placeholder text value '%serverping:<serverIP>%' to get the ping to a server by its IP
- Added: Placeholder text value '%servermotd:<serverIP>%' to get the MOTD (message of the day) of a server by its IP
 
- Changed: Removed "Reset Clicksound" option for Vanilla and custom buttons (Now you can remove the sound just by setting and empty sound path)
- Changed: Removed "Reset Hoversound" option for Vanilla and custom buttons (Now you can remove the sound just by setting and empty sound path)
- Changed: Editor now saves all customizations for Vanilla buttons even if they are hidden/deleted
- Changed: Reworked button background system
  - Added support for GIFs and animations to be set as background
