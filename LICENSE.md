KEKSUCCINO MOD LICENSE (KML)
 
This license is aiming on giving people the ability to use my mod as dependency for their own mods and
in modpacks while my code is still save and can't be used for low effort projects and other fishy things without asking for permission first.
I want to keep my projects open-sourced but feel like that I need to protect my code because of some people.
 
Summary:
I don't want to over-complicate things with this, so to keep it short,
feel free to use my mod as library for your own mods, but don't copy it into your mod, just use it as normal mod dependency.
Don't ship my mod with your mod, let users or your mod download my mod from the official source (CurseForge).
