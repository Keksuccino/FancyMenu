- **Official Download Requirement:** Any dependency or modpack reference must point to the official download sources provided by the author.


## Definitions

- **Mod Definition**: For the purposes of this license, the terms "this mod" or "the mod" refer to the entire product or project this license accompanies. This includes, but is not limited to, the source code, the compiled JAR files, associated assets, documentation, and any other related components distributed under this license.

- **Private**: "Private" means that any modified version of the mod is used solely by the individual who made the modifications and is not shared with, distributed to, or made accessible to ANYONE else.

- **Public**: "Public" means sharing the mod or any portion of its source code in any form that is accessible to other individuals. This includes, for example, uploading the mod or its code to public repositories or mod hosting sites such as Modrinth, CurseForge, etc.


## Terms and Conditions

1. **Usage in Modpacks and as Dependencies**
   - **1.1.** You may include this mod in modpacks as a mod reference. In such cases, the mod **must not** be physically included or shipped within the pack’s files. Instead, it should be listed as a dependency that the end-user or end-user’s mod launcher downloads from the official source (see Section 5).
   - **1.2.** When used as a dependency in any project, the mod must be obtained from an official download source (see Section 5). No part of its JAR file or code should be embedded in the distributed product.

2. **Creating Addons and Extensions**
   - **2.1.** You are free to develop addons or integrate support for this mod into your own projects.
   - **2.2.** Your project must not include any portion of this mod’s source code or its compiled JAR file. Instead, it should reference the mod as an external dependency that gets downloaded from an official download source (see Section 5).

3. **Redistribution Prohibitions**
   - **3.1.** You may not re-upload, re-distribute, or otherwise publicly share the mod’s compiled JAR or any portion of its source code without obtaining explicit permission from the author.
   - **3.2.** **Forking Exception and Public Forks**: You are permitted to publicly fork the mod’s source code (for example, by hosting it on a public repository such as GitHub) for the purposes of personal modifications or contributions. However, while public forks of the source code are allowed, any distribution of a compiled version (e.g., the JAR file) derived from such a fork is strictly prohibited unless you have obtained explicit permission from the author.

4. **Personal Use and Modification**
   - **4.1.** You may freely use and modify the mod’s source code or mod file for personal use.
   - **4.2.** Any modifications made for personal use must remain private. Public re-uploading or distribution of any modified (or unmodified) version is strictly forbidden without permission.

5. **Official Download Source Requirement**
   - **5.1.** For modpacks, the mod reference must clearly point to an official download source, ensuring that end-users are directed to download the mod only from that designated source. It is acceptable for mod launchers (for example, CurseForge launcher, Modrinth launcher, Technic Launcher, ATLauncher, etc.) to automatically download the mod to the end-user’s system, as long as the mod is obtained from the official download sources:
     - https://curseforge.com/members/keksuccino  
     - https://modrinth.com/user/keksuccino
   - **5.2.** When used as a dependency, the mod must not be bundled within your distributed files. Instead, it should be configured as an external dependency, ensuring that it is downloaded either directly by the end-user or automatically by their mod launcher from the official download sources listed above.

6. **Permission Requests**
   - **6.1.** If you wish to re-upload, re-distribute, or otherwise publicly share any portions of the mod's code or the mod itself (or any version of it) in a manner not permitted by these Terms and Conditions, you must first obtain explicit permission from the author.
   - **6.2.** To request such permission, please contact the author via Discord. Join the Discord server at https://discord.gg/rhayah27GC and send a private message to @keksuccino detailing your intended use.
   - **6.3.** The author reserves the right to approve or deny any permission request at their sole discretion.
