CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.5.1 [ W I P !! Not public yet !! ]

- The old "Custom Localizations" system got removed, so it's now not possible anymore to load localizations using FancyMenu's own localization file format
  - Loading Vanilla Minecraft localization files via resource pack still works like before, so this is now the new default to load custom localizations
