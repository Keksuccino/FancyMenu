CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.7.0 [ W I P !! Not public yet !! ]

- Dropped support for MC 1.21.7
- Added back "Player Entity" element in MC 1.21.4+ (#1191)
  - This new element is sadly not compatible with old ones, so you need to remake Player Entity elements in MC 1.21.4+ (sorry for that!)
  - Now supports rotating the entity's body on the Z axis
  - Now supports normal element resizing like other elements (no need to set a scale anymore)
-
