CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.9.0 [ W I P !! Not public yet !! ]

- Added a new kind/category of customizations: Global Customizations (#1355)
  - These customizations are different to most others in the mod, because they do not need you to enable customizations for a screen to apply them
  - Can be accessed via "menu bar -> Customization -> Global Customizations" while NOT in the layout editor
  - Allows you to change Vanilla button textures globally for all screens without using a resource pack
  - Allows you to change Vanilla menu music globally for all screens without using a resource pack
  - Many of the customization options previously located in "menu bar -> Customization -> Settings" (like custom window icon/title, etc.) are now located in the new "Global Customizations" menu
- Added a new type of fullscreen customization: Decoration Overlays
  - These overlays have pre-defined overlay types, similar to menu background types and they can be toggled on/off for each overlay type
  - Decoration overlays can be accessed via right-clicking the layout editor background -> Decoration Overlays
  - Currently there are three overlay types available:
    - Snowfall, that makes it snow in your menus with snow accumulation on the ground and buttons (with customizable snow color and intensity)
    - Rainfall, that makes it rain in menus, with forming puddles and dripping water from buttons (with customizable rain color and intensity)
    - Fireflies, to have groups of fireflies fly around in the menu and sometimes landing on the ground and on buttons (with customizable color, group amount, group density, group size, etc.)
- Added a file browser for Minecraft resources to the "Choose Resource" screen, so you can now browse nearly all resources loaded via resource packs like a normal directory
