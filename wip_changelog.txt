- Added "Create File in Game Directory" action to create new empty files in the instance's game directory and the ".minecraft" directory (#1242)

- Added "Download File to Game Directory" action to download files to the instance's game directory and the ".minecraft" directory (#1242)
  - There's also a listener that triggers when a file finishes downloading via this action (also includes if the download succeeded or not)
- Added "Write File in Game Directory" action to write text content to files in the instance's game directory and the ".minecraft" directory (#1242)
- Added "File Size" placeholder to get the size of a local file in bytes (#1244)
- Added "File MD5" placeholder to get the MD5 hash of a local file
- Added "Print to Game Log" action to print text to the game's log for debugging (#1267)
- Improved the "flow" of the action script building process
  - Clicking "Edit" now only works when an action is selected that has a value
  - Clicking "Edit" now goes straight to the Edit Action Value screen instead of opening the action type selection first
  - The "Edit Value" and "Done" buttons in the action type selection have been merged into one button that shows either "Next Step" or "Done" depending on if the selected action type needs a value or not
  - Double-clicking on an action type in the action selection list now works as a shortcut to clicking "Next Step"/"Done"
- It's now possible to double-click requirements in the requirement selection list of the Add/Edit Requirement Screen
  - When the requirement has a value, double-clicking opend the Edit Value screen, if not, it works as a shortcut to pressing "Done"
- The description boxes of the selection screens for actions and requirements now have line wrapping for their description boxes so you don't need to scroll horizontally anymore
- You can now target the default ".minecraft" directory in the "File Text" placeholder by starting the target file path with ".minecraft/" (#1242)
- You can now target the default ".minecraft" directory in the "File/Folder Exists" requirement by starting the target file path with ".minecraft/" (#1242)
- Fixed "World Save Data" placeholder being in the wrong category
- Fixed text in some of FancyMenu's screen's looks bad in light mode (text was hard to read because it didn't change to a dark color for contrast)
- Fixed missing localizations for some options of the new (1.21.4+) Player Entity element (#1276)
