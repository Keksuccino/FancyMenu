CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.7.0 [ W I P !! Not public yet !! ]

- Dropped support for MC 1.21.7
- Added back "Player Entity" element in MC 1.21.4+ (#1191)
  - This new element is sadly not compatible with old ones, so you need to remake Player Entity elements in MC 1.21.4+ (sorry for that!)
  - Now supports rotating the entity's body on the Z axis
  - Now supports normal element resizing like other elements (no need to set a scale anymore)
- Removed old unused "Preload Animations" options from FancyMenu's settings, since it was only for the old animation system that does not exist anymore
- Reverted the changes I did to the caching logic of placeholders and requirements, because they created more problems than they solved (#1215)
  - I instead added settings to set individual, custom caching durations for requirements and placeholders (or disable caching by setting the duration to 0)
- Fixed complex custom logic using placeholders and requirments lags/flickers in some cases due to the caching of placeholders and requirements (#1213)
-
