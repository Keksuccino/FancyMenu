CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.8.0 [ W I P !! Not public yet !! ]

- Added a new system: Listeners (#1247)
  - Listeners can make you, well, listen to specific game events like mouse movement, mouse clicks, keyboard key presses, menus getting opened/closed and even in-world events like entities dying, the player gaining an effect or spotting an entity and SO MUCH MORE!
  - You can add multiple listeners for the same event type and each listener can execute its own action script when triggered
  - Listeners are the only system in FancyMenu that is constantly enabled, even when you are not in menus, which means listeners constantly listen to events and can trigger their action scripts, even if you have no menu open (while walking around in a world, for example)
  - To manage (add/edit/remove) listeners, click on "Customization -> Manage Listeners" in the menu bar when NOT IN THE EDITOR
- Added rotation support for many element types, which means you can now freely rotate them (#1258)
  - In basic mode you can use the rotation grabber to easily rotate the element or you can set the rotation manually in the element's right-click menu
  - In advanced mode, the rotation value supports placeholders, which gives you maximum control over the element's rotation, but in this mode the rotation grabber is disabled
  - It is possible to disable the visual rotation controls in the editor settings (menu bar -> Window -> Element Rotation Controls) to not see the grabber anymore
  - You can Shift-click the rotation grabber to make it snap to 45 degree steps
- Added tilt support (horizontal and vertical) for many element types, which means you can now tilt them (#1259)
  - In basic mode you can use the tilt grabbers to easily tilt the element or you can set the tilt manually in the element's right-click menu
  - In advanced mode, the tilt values support placeholders, which gives you maximum control over the element's vertical/horizontal tilt, but in this mode the tilt grabbers are disabled
  - It is possible to disable the tilt visual tilt controls in the editor settings (menu bar -> Window -> Element Tilt Controls) to not see the grabbers anymore
  - You can Shift-click the tilt grabbers to make them snap to 15 degree steps
- Added "Has Player Permission Level" requirement to check if the player has a specific permission level (like level 4 for operator) (#1239)
- Added "Is Resource Pack Enabled" requirement to check if a resource pack is enabled by its display name (#1002)

  - The old version of the element is a seperate one and keeps working for now, but it is marked as deprecated now and will be removed in the future
- Some placeholders now show an error when the user tries to use them in an asynchronous environment (like a Ticker element) when they can't safely get parsed asynchronously

- Improved the "flow" of the action script building process
  - Clicking "Edit" now only works when an action is selected that has a value
  - Clicking "Edit" now goes straight to the Edit Action Value screen instead of opening the action type selection first
  - The "Edit Value" and "Done" buttons in the action type selection have been merged into one button that shows either "Next Step" or "Done" depending on if the selected action type needs a value or not
  - Double-clicking on an action type in the action selection list now works as a shortcut to clicking "Next Step"/"Done"

  - When the requirement has a value, double-clicking opend the Edit Value screen, if not, it works as a shortcut to pressing "Done"
- The description boxes of the selection screens for actions and requirements now have line wrapping for their description boxes so you don't need to scroll horizontally anymore
- You can now target the default ".minecraft" directory in the "File Text" placeholder by starting the target file path with ".minecraft/" (#1242)

- The Markdown renderer now has basic character escaping support via leading backslash to make formatting-related characters render as literal characters, like underscores, ticks, brackets, etc. (#1319)
  - This finally makes it possible to print player names with underscores (if you get the player name via placeholder, use the "Replace Text" placeholder to replace "_" with "\_")
- Updated the list of Patreon supporters in the Credits screen (Thanks so much to all the supporters and big sorry for updating the list so slowly, but I always forget that screen exists lmao)
- The former "Get NBT Data" placeholder got optimized for working entirely client-side and got renamed to "Get NBT Data (Client-Side)"
- Most of FancyMenu's UI tooltips (like in context menus, etc.) now have line wrapping, so tooltips don't get too long anymore in some cases (#1314)
- The "Round (Math)" placeholder now has a "decimal" option to define what decimal place the number should get rounded to (existing placeholders keep working like before) (#1308)
- The information displayed at element borders (X/Y position, size, etc.) should be a lot easier to read now
  - Now uses FancyMenu's UI scale setting instead of a hardcoded scale (#1281)

- The "Manage Target Elements" screen of the "Element Animator" element got some QoL improvements
  - It now lets you delete targets in the same screen without going to a second screen first
  - It now has an option to remove targets by ID, so you can easily copy an element's ID in the editor and then remove it there without searching it in long target lists first
- Renamed the "Screen Identifier" placeholder to "Current Screen Identifier" to make it more clear what it does exactly
- The Widgets menu in the menu bar of the layout editor (menu bar -> UI -> Widgets) now supports toggling each widget instead of just enabling it on left-click
- Fixed "World Save Data" placeholder being in the wrong category
- Fixed text in some of FancyMenu's screen's looks bad in light mode (text was hard to read because it didn't change to a dark color for contrast)

- Fixed Discord Join button in menu bar does not work (#1263)
- Fixed WHILE blocks cannot be moved via drag-and-drop or via buttons in the Edit Action Script screen
  - I'm actually not sure if that is a bug that was public or if I just messed it up while working on the screen, but it's fixed now anyways lmao

- Fixed Layers widget in Layout Editor screen sometimes not fully interactable (unable to click on visibility icon, unable to drag scroll grabber, etc.) (#1154)
  - I'm actually not sure if I fully fixed that, since the bug(s) trigger randomly, so it's super hard to tell if it actually got fixed..
