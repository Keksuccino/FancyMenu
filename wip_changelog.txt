CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.8.0 [ W I P !! Not public yet !! ]

- Added a new system: Listeners (#1247)
  - Listeners can make you, well, listen to specific game events like mouse movement, mouse clicks, keyboard key presses, menus getting opened/closed and even in-world events like entities dying, the player gaining an effect or spotting an entity and SO MUCH MORE!
  - You can add multiple listeners for the same event type and each listener can execute its own action script when triggered
  - Listeners are the only system in FancyMenu that is constantly enabled, even when you are not in menus, which means listeners constantly listen to events and can trigger their action scripts, even if you have no menu open (while walking around in a world, for example)
  - To manage (add/edit/remove) listeners, click on "Customization -> Manage Listeners" in the menu bar when NOT IN THE EDITOR
- Added rotation support for many element types, which means you can now freely rotate them (#1258)
  - In basic mode you can use the rotation grabber to easily rotate the element or you can set the rotation manually in the element's right-click menu
  - In advanced mode, the rotation value supports placeholders, which gives you maximum control over the element's rotation, but in this mode the rotation grabber is disabled
  - It is possible to disable the visual rotation controls in the editor settings (menu bar -> Window -> Element Rotation Controls) to not see the grabber anymore
  - You can Shift-click the rotation grabber to make it snap to 45 degree steps
- Added tilt support (horizontal and vertical) for many element types, which means you can now tilt them (#1259)
  - In basic mode you can use the tilt grabbers to easily tilt the element or you can set the tilt manually in the element's right-click menu
  - In advanced mode, the tilt values support placeholders, which gives you maximum control over the element's vertical/horizontal tilt, but in this mode the tilt grabbers are disabled
  - It is possible to disable the tilt visual tilt controls in the editor settings (menu bar -> Window -> Element Tilt Controls) to not see the grabbers anymore
  - You can Shift-click the tilt grabbers to make them snap to 15 degree steps
- Added "Has Player Permission Level" requirement to check if the player has a specific permission level (like level 4 for operator) (#1239)
- Added "Is Resource Pack Enabled" requirement to check if a resource pack is enabled by its display name (#1002)
- Added "Is Any Screen Open" requirement that returns true when ANY screen is open (useful for listeners, since they work outside menus) (#1275)
- Added "Mimic Keybind" action to mimic pressing one of Minecraft's keybinds (the ones you see in the Controls screen) (#1287)
- Added "Display in Chat [Client-Side]" action to print messages to the local chat (without sending them to the server) (#1286)

  - There's also a listener that triggers when a file finishes downloading via this action (also includes if the download succeeded or not)
- Added "Write File in Game Directory" action to write text content to files in the instance's game directory and the ".minecraft" directory (#1242)
- Added "File Size" placeholder to get the size of a local file in bytes (#1244)
- Added "File MD5" placeholder to get the MD5 hash of a local file
- Added "Print to Game Log" action to print text to the game's log for debugging (#1267)

- Some placeholders now show an error when the user tries to use them in an asynchronous environment (like a Ticker element) when they can't safely get parsed asynchronously
- Some actions now show an error when the user tries to use them in an asynchronous environment (like a Ticker element) when they can't safely execute asynchronously
- Some requirements now show an error when the user tries to use them in an asynchronous environment (like a Ticker element) when they can't safely be used asynchronously
- Improved the "flow" of the action script building process
  - Clicking "Edit" now only works when an action is selected that has a value
  - Clicking "Edit" now goes straight to the Edit Action Value screen instead of opening the action type selection first
  - The "Edit Value" and "Done" buttons in the action type selection have been merged into one button that shows either "Next Step" or "Done" depending on if the selected action type needs a value or not
  - Double-clicking on an action type in the action selection list now works as a shortcut to clicking "Next Step"/"Done"
- It's now possible to double-click requirements in the requirement selection list of the Add/Edit Requirement Screen
  - When the requirement has a value, double-clicking opend the Edit Value screen, if not, it works as a shortcut to pressing "Done"
- The description boxes of the selection screens for actions and requirements now have line wrapping for their description boxes so you don't need to scroll horizontally anymore
- You can now target the default ".minecraft" directory in the "File Text" placeholder by starting the target file path with ".minecraft/" (#1242)
- You can now target the default ".minecraft" directory in the "File/Folder Exists" requirement by starting the target file path with ".minecraft/" (#1242)
- It's now possible to use placeholders in the tint value of Image elements (#1271)
- Updated the list of Patreon supporters in the Credits screen (Thanks so much to all the supporters and big sorry for updating the list so slowly, but I always forget that screen exists lmao)
- Fixed "World Save Data" placeholder being in the wrong category
- Fixed text in some of FancyMenu's screen's looks bad in light mode (text was hard to read because it didn't change to a dark color for contrast)
- Fixed missing localizations for some options of the new (1.21.4+) Player Entity element (#1276)
- Fixed Discord Join button in menu bar does not work (#1263)
- Fixed WHILE blocks cannot be moved via drag-and-drop or via buttons in the Edit Action Script screen
  - I'm actually not sure if that is a bug that was public or if I just messed it up while working on the screen, but it's fixed now anyways lmao
