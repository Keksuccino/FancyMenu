CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.7.0 [ W I P !! Not public yet !! ]

- Dropped support for MC 1.21.7
- This is probably the last build that will support the Forge mod loader in MC 1.21.1+, future builds will drop support for it (NeoForge is still supported - this is just for (Lex)Forge)
- Added back "Player Entity" element in MC 1.21.4+ (#1191)
  - Now needs "FER" (Fancy Entity Renderer) for rendering the element (this is a new optional dependency - without this mod installed, the Player Entity element will not work)
  - This new element is sadly not compatible with old ones, so you need to remake Player Entity elements in MC 1.21.4+ (sorry for that!)
  - Now supports rotating the entity's body on the Z axis
  - Now supports normal element resizing like other elements (no need to set a scale anymore)
  - Now has a setting to set Vanilla's existing poses (like standing, crouching, swimming, sleeping, etc.)
  - Now has a setting to enable "body movement", which basically plays idle animations like arms moving around, etc. when enabled (or other pose-related movement like the swimming animation)
  - The new Player Entity element will get backported to older MC versions in the future when "FER" (Fancy Entity Renderer) gets released for these older versions
- Added "Is MCEF Loaded" requirement to check if the MCEF mod is loaded, which is needed for the Browser element and all video-related features
- It is now possible to execute FancyMenu's actions from within the "Browser" element, which means you can now basically make web-based UIs
- Removed old unused "Preload Animations" options from FancyMenu's settings, since it was only for the old animation system that does not exist anymore
- Reverted the changes I did to the caching logic of placeholders and requirements, because they created more problems than they solved (#1215)
  - I instead added settings to set individual, custom caching durations for requirements and placeholders (or disable caching by setting the duration to 0) (#1194, #1193)
- For devs: It is no longer possible to register actions that have the character ":" in its identifier (this will result in a crash now)
- Fixed complex custom logic using placeholders and requirments lags/flickers in some cases due to the caching of placeholders and requirements (#1213)
- Fixed negative widget coordinates produce errors in widget ID calculation (#1226, #1206)
- Fixed log error spam related to packets (#1217, #1163)
- Fixed "Last Server/World Name" placeholder ignores "full_world_path=false" when its return type is set to "both" (#1214)
- Fixed Forge builds crash on launch in some MC versions (#1229)
- Fixed mouse in Browser element stays pressed when releasing mouse outside the browser window
- Fixed keyboard input not working in Browser element (#1207)
-
