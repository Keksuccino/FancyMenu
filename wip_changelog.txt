CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.8.0 [ W I P !! Not public yet !! ]

- Added "Print to Game Log" action to print text to the game's log for debugging (#1267)
- Improved the "flow" of the action script building process
  - Clicking "Edit" now only works when an action is selected that has a value
  - Clicking "Edit" now goes straight to the Edit Action Value screen instead of opening the action type selection first
  - The "Edit Value" and "Done" buttons in the action type selection have been merged into one button that shows either "Next Step" or "Done" depending on if the selected action type needs a value or not
  - Double-clicking on an action type in the action selection list now works as a shortcut to clicking "Next Step"/"Done"
- It's now possible to double-click requirements in the requirement selection list of the Add/Edit Requirement Screen
  - When the requirement has a value, double-clicking opend the Edit Value screen, if not, it works as a shortcut to pressing "Done"
- The description boxes of the selection screens for actions and requirements now have line wrapping for their description boxes so you don't need to scroll horizonally anymore
- Fixed "World Save Data" placeholder being in the wrong category
- Fixed text in some of FancyMenu's screen's looks bad in light mode (text was hard to read because it didn't change to a dark color for contrast)
