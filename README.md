FancyMenu is a forge-based minecraft mod to customize ingame menus in many ways.

A special thing about FancyMenu is, that it's not limited to the basic minecraft menus like the options or inventory menu.<br>
With FancyMenu, it's possible to customize nearly every default-looking menu in the game. Even menus from other mods.

Some of its key features are:<br>
- Hide, move, resize and rename buttons
- Create buttons to open links or send messages
- Add lines of text to menu screens and format them
- Animate the background of menus
- Add textures and animations to menus
- Add audio to menus and animations
- Play animations as game intro before the main menu loads<br>
